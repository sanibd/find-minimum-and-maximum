# find-minimum-and-maximum
C program to find both minimum and maximum number between three numbers


In this program, a program has been written on how to determine both maximum and minimum numbers from 3 numbers together.
Many have shown programs to find only the maximum or the minimum number in the name of the maximum minimum.
But I didn't find a program to get the two out together. So I wrote this program. Thanks.
